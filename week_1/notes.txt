Docker compose here sets up two containers one for PGAdmin and another postgres. They then expose these containers on port 5432.

When you run the pgcli command you tell it which port to look for and then sees that there is a psotgres setup behind that port 
and connects

There is no point creating a network here since each container has their own. So once you've run docker compose use docker inspect
on the container to find it. The host name is the container name (check with docker ps).
